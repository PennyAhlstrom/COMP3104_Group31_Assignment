COMP 2156 DevOps - course notes

CI/CD automates build, test, and integration steps to improve speed and reliability.

A DevOps engineer ensures software isn’t done until it’s successfully delivered to users, meeting expectations around availability, performance, and pace of change.

Infrastructure Automation → systems, configs, deployments as code

Continuous Delivery → automated build, test, deploy pipelines

Monitoring & Feedback → transparency, reporting, shortened lead time
