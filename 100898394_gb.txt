James Jones - COMP3104 - Git Bash Notes

Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments that provides an emulation layer for a Git command-line experience.
It is part of the Git for Windows package and allows Windows users to interact with Git and execute Git commands in a Bash shell
environment. 

Key aspects of Git Bash:

1. Git Integration:
   It provides access to the full suite of Git commands for version control, enabling users to manage repositories, commit changes, 
   merge branches, and interact with remote repositories.

2. Bash Shell:
   It includes the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) command-line interpreter, which is the default shell on Linux and macOS. 
   This allows Windows users to utilize common Unix-like commands (e.g., ls, pwd, cp, mv) in addition to Git commands.

3. Emulation Layer:
   Since Windows is not a Unix-based operating system, Git Bash provides the necessary emulation to run Git's command-line tools,
   which were originally designed for Unix-like environments.

4. Utilities:
   It also includes various useful Bash utilities, such as ssh, cat, scp, and nano, enhancing the command-line experience on Windows.
   In essence, Git Bash brings the familiar and powerful command-line environment of Unix-like systems to Windows, making it easier 
   for developers to work with Git and perform common development tasks from the terminal.
