James Jones - SDLC Phases and Methodologies
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test high-quality software. 
SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.
The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user's requirements.

SDLC in software engineering models outlines the plan for each stage so that each stage of the software development model 
can perform its task efficiently to deliver the software at a low cost within a given time frame that meets users requirements. 
In this article we will see Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in detail.
