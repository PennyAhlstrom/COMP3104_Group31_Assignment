DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
DevOps plays a vital role in modern software development and today’s fast-paced technology landscape.
Incorporating DevOps into the development process ensures faster delivery, higher quality, and more reliable software. By streamlining the workflow from coding to deployment—through effective collaboration, continuous integration, and built-in testing and monitoring—the overall outcome is greatly improved. 
DevOps also fosters a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility, encouraging developers and operations teams to work together toward common goals. This approach not only improves communication but also leads to more proactive problem-solving and innovation. Errors are minimized, changes can be made quickly, and the final product is dependable. DevOps is truly essential in achieving efficiency and excellence in software development.
