## Project Description
- Practice Git basics: branch, commit, push, PR, and conflict resolution.
- Implement a per-developer branching strategy to protect `main`.
- Configure a minimal CI workflow with GitHub Actions to validate pushes and PRs.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Switch to your branch using `git checkout STUDENTID-Name`.
3. Install any dependencies as listed.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Branching Strategy
Each member has their own branch named `STUDENTID-Name`. All changes are merged into the `main` branch via Pull Requests.


## Getting Started (Local)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PennyAhlstrom/COMP3104_Group31_Assignment.git
